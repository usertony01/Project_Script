# Project_Script
This legacy script is a combination of my learning of specific RStudio packages. 
The script is a combination of three functions, one obtaining relevant Twitter hashtag data using RStudio. 
Two, assess the sentiment of those data through various sentiment libraries. 
Three, generate an output to use in association with Gephi for network analysis. 

*note* the RStudio package Rtweet has been updated / modified since this script was written.
