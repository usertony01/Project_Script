# Project_Script
This legacy script is a combination several RStudio packages that I have learned and used over the past year. 
The script purpose to one, obtaining relevant Twitter hashtag data using RStudio. 
Two, assess the sentiment of those data through various sentiment libraries. 
Three, generate an output to use in association with an open source program called Gephi for network analysis. 

*note* the RStudio package Rtweet has been updated / modified since this script was written. 
The current Rtweet package will perform these functions this script.
